# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-SVM

## INTRODUCTION
Many students struggle to finish different courses in higher educational
establishments since no specific help is provided to those who require particular
attention in the registered courses. To make college more affordable, it is critical
to ensure that a large number of students graduate on time by intervening early
on individuals whose performance is unlikely to achieve the degree program's
graduation standards on time. Building a system that can continually track
students' academic achievement and reliably forecast their future performance,
such as when they are expected to graduate and their predicted final GPAs, is a
vital step toward successful intervention. Different machine learning models can
be developed to predict students’ grades in the enrolled courses, which provide
valuable information to facilitate students’ retention in those courses. This
information can be used to early identify students at-risk based on which a
system can suggest the instructors to provide special attention to those students

## METHODOLOGY
A comprehensive study of the literature on grade/GPA prediction was
conducted in order to create a machine learning model for predicting student
performance. There were 33 characteristics in the information gathered,
including parental education, house locations, family size, absenteeism, and so
on. Once that, state-of-the-art machine learning approaches were evaluated in
forecasting student performance after the dataset was analysed. Finally, we
examined the accuracy and MSE of all of the classification models that were
used to determine whether or not a student needed to put more effort into that
course.

## RESULTS
Analysis of educational data, particularly the impact of social environment and
family on students' performance, is critical for improving the quality of
education for future generations. The best classification method was one of our
primary problems. We tried a variety of classification methods, including
Decision Trees, KNN, and SVM, and assessed them using various metrics, such
as the f1 score and MSE, before deciding on SVM as the winner, with a
precision of 95% when compared to other algorithms. Our findings indicate
that machine learning algorithms can predict or classify any educational data,
and that the results may be improved by using multiple types of data selection
and machine learning techniques.
